# Finding-and-Visualization-of-most-dominant-images
The goal is to find dominant images and visualize them. Image-image graph is calculated and is taken as the input graph. The dominant images in this graph are found by applying the PageRank algorithm. The dominance of the page is determined by the number of times, a random surfer will land on that webpage. In our case webpage is basically an image. Thus, using this algorithm ideally we should get the images which will have more incoming links as more dominant.
